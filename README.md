Hello there!

So this is a simple Blink reminder application which u can use while working on ur personal device (PC or Laptops), it will work as an overlay and keep reminding you to blink every 4 seconds
(as it shows online average healthy blink rate is every 4 secs).
Keep in mind that it does not work for games since the game kinda works with the windows/linux/mac system and is intergrated with it and this app is not really integrated with the device CMD level,
I have tried but to no avail since Node js and Electron js dont seem to have a way to do that. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

You can make this into an actual executable (blinklin-v1.0.exe) file for ur convenience by following the electron js website instructions, their pretty clear and easy to follow along.

Im also planning to integrate sort of a AI/ML element to this application since its just a static reminder to blink, I would like to use the Webcam from the device to monitor blink rate and 
dynamically adjust the blink rate according to the user and add a 2 hour timer to remind the user to take a break in screentime and sort of add a user approved screen-locking mechanism, but let see! 

Any additions/uggestions and constructive criticisms are greatly appreciated! :)
